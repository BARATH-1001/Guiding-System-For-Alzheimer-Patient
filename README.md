# Guiding-System-For-Alzheimer-Patients

**Project Overview:**  
The **Guiding System for Alzheimer’s Patients** is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals with Alzheimer's disease by continuously tracking their location. This system combines GPS tracking technology with the SIM 800L GSM module, allowing real-time location updates to be sent directly to the caregiver, even in areas without internet connectivity.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Location Tracking:** Using a GPS module, the system accurately determines the patient’s location at all times.
- **Instant Caregiver Notifications:** Location data is transmitted to the caregiver via SMS using the SIM 800L module, ensuring communication is maintained in any environment without reliance on the internet.
- **Emergency Alert System:** In case of an emergency, the system can be programmed to send immediate alerts with precise location coordinates.
- **Energy-efficient and Portable Design:** Designed for long-term use with minimal power consumption, making it ideal for continuous monitoring.

**Objective:**  
To enhance the quality of care for Alzheimer’s patients by providing a reliable, always-connected location tracking system that works seamlessly, even in areas without internet, ensuring the safety and peace of mind for both patients and caregivers.

This system not only helps locate patients quickly in the event of disorientation or wandering but also provides caregivers with a robust tool to ensure the safety of their loved ones in real-time.
